            <li>The only challenges I had with this first assignment was with the formatting of the html code. I have never written in html before, and all the different headers in the code itself were confusing at first. I got through this by just looking things up. I rewatched some of the lectures, and looked at example code online to grasp the basics of these simple headers.</li>
            <li>Everything I did in this assignment was new to me, I didn't know any of it previously. I learned about html headers, and some of the basic text formatting. Header types, list types, bloded text, italicized text. and paragraphs to name a few.</li>
            <li>The most useful resources were the lecture recordings, and the example code from lectures. I used these resources as guides in how the html language worked. </li>
